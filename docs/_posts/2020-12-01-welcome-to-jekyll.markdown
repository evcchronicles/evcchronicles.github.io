Tis the first post of the EVC Chronicles! And honestly, I have not much to say. I'll just post an excerpt of a old log I made yesterday:

# December 1, 2020
The EVC Chronicles was born on Blogger with the URL: evcchronicles.blogspot.com. Similarly, a Gmail account was also created for the EVC Chronicles: evcchroniclesadmin@gmail.com.

This was the planning stage and I had been drafting rules and creating documentation. After a few days, I planned to create a mockup for the blog itself. *(Dec 2: note that since I eventually ended up using static site generator I gave up on making a mockup)*

...

I anticipate what this future project will hold. Above all, though, the spirit of the EVC Chronicles should always remain lighthearted: not to expose or to degrade others but rather to revel and share in the history of the PSHS-EVC campus. The history of the campus may soon die out -- we watch the old admin, faculty, and alumni leave the school but surely, with our efforts, we can leave them remembered.

# Afterword
The blog was moved to GitHub Pages. As of now, I'm legit just trying to figure this out lol.

And that's pretty much it.
