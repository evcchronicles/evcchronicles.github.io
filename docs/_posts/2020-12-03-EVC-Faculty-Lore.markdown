There have been many speculations around the faculty of PSHS-EVC. For one, a certain Social Science teacher was rumored to have teleportation powers. After all, he never even ran around the school. And if he did, according to the testimony of a now alumni, it was a great shock. With his slow pace of walking, he somehow managed to get to every class on time. Truly, it was something *magical*, at the very least.

Of course, he couldn't have been the only teacher rumored with such powers. As rumors would have said, other Social Science teachers were capable of teleportation. Depending on who you asked, it may have been one or two, or all of the Social Science teachers. There was even supposedly a legend of a certain alumni who also was capable of teleportation, the time-displaced version of the original teleportaion master. But that, would be another story.

Now, one of the former teachers in the Social Science faculty was not usually mentioned to be a teleporter but rather a supernatural being. Video footage of the "Supreme Vampire Reborn" was found on his YouTube channel, with the faculty member playing a role of a vampire. Mentions of a sequel had been dropped, but as of now, there has still been no report of a sequel for the "Supreme Vampire Reborn"

# Other Faculty?
It seems to be that the non-human population of the EVC campus is greater than was thought. One of the Biology teachers on campus was said to be a plant in human form. Although it seemed his prevalent use of hats and umbrellas were meant to shield himself away from sunlight, people believe otherwise. Theories around these objects were said that they were meant to facilitate the photosynthesis that he needs to survive. Who knows? Is he a plant?
