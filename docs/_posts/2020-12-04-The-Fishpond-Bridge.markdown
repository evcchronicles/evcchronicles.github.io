Things may become obsolete, but its memories stay true in our hearts and in our lives. That bridge in the fish pond is one example.

Back in 2000s where PSHS-EVC used to rent a small lot in Palo, Leyte for the first time. Nipa huts served as classrooms; the walls were made of wood, and it was swelling hot outside. When students and teachers wanted to reach the campus, one needed to cross that bridge. After a few years of landscaping and site development, a concrete academic building stood with the roads and space for future site development.

With the changes, the bridge served another purpose: it became a popular site for couples, daredevils, and photoshoots. Despite the intensive beautifications, the lagoon and the bridge was kept to its original, and it became the only place thriving with aquatic life. Later on in 2018, ducks entered the scene and they spend their time waddling on the bridge. Unfortunately for the bridge, it never got repaired. Cracks show from the planks, and despite surviving Yolanda, you can see how old, tired, and dilapidated this 30-year bridge.

And that's the fishpond bridge of PSHS-EVC.
