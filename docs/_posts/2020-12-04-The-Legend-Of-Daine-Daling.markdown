I guess you haven't known him.

Daine Daling was a smart student. Every year, he always got into the Director's List but there's a catch: he always had a bad temper and a daredevil attitutde. One time, he went to a classroom where a teacher was teaching, wrote scribbles on the blackboard, cursed the teacher, and went out. Obviously, he went to the Discipline Office for his mischief. However, some say because of his sheer intellect and persuasion, he went out unscathed. He didn't get any suspension for what he did, nor get any calling from his parents.

This is not only the peak of his intelligence. Every Quarter Exams, you know where he goes to before, during, and after that event? TO THE COMPUTER SHOP PLAYING DOTA. Yes, he goes there to relax. During classes, you won't see him bring books. He always bring a small sling bag, and a very small notebook about the size of his palm. Yet, despite of this he always get into the Dean's List.

And that's the legacy of Daine Daling.
