In March 11 2019, nearing the last days before the pandemic had driven all the students away from the campus, there was a ruckus.
There was an event of great anticipation which was apparently a day free of classes - the pandemic was drawing near and many had plans to get home early to recuperate. However, the suspension of classes was suddenly cancelled the day before. It caused quite a great shock to many and from great shock came a great wave of anger.

A suggestion came from the student body that a petition may be able to possibly override a decision if given enough support in the form of signatures. This quickly led to lines of students waiting to sign blank sheets of paper. The sheets were then stapled to a letter from the Student Alliance, containing a statement with their intentions to revoke the cancellation of the suspension of classes.

However, and there were many factors behind this, that led to classes happening the next day. Majority of the students attended classes, although some decided to cut class or go absent entirely. Some teachers did not hold class on that day. The public responses of the student body were mostly in support of the petition, although the way they were expressed varied wildly. Some students were against the petition and voiced out their opinions on it.

There were claims of students forcing their juniors to sign, however this is disputable. Majority of the seniors were practicing for their prom on the first floor, away from the juniors' classrooms. There were also disputes on the validity of the petition itself due to how it was administered (students signed blank pages without an attached letter) or how the student body did not appeal to the admin first before proceeding to the petition.

In the end, however, the effect of the pandemic was inevitable and a few days later, classes were cancelled until they resumed this September in the form of online classes.
