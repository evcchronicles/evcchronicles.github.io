Imagine yourself as a person with incredible memory. You can memorize anything you want to know, and recall it easily when needed. Now, there's a weakness you have: you are emotional. Yet you can muster incredible strength when you're angry. Such a strong quirk, right? Yes, it is strong. Yet, can you survive it?

Yes you can. Someone in school displayed those qualities, and his alias for this story goes by the name Dennis. (the first three letters are correct yet for confidential reasons we'll make the rest of the letters wrong for confidential reason).

## High School Experience

In 2013, Dennis enters the school. Dennis excelled in elementary like all the students who entered yet his elementary peers never expected much of him. They said, "Dennis will never last, since he will get kicked out anyway in a year for his violence". However, he proved them wrong. He was known from his early years as a voracious reader. With sheer enthusiasm, he can remember lots of things in his mind. He is so knowledgeable in Social Science, trivias, and other scientific facts. Never once in his time he did something violent.

Not only he is smart, but he is also interested with games. He can play Minecraft, Kerbal Space Program, and also Counter Strike. You can find him doing those either outside the classroom, or inside his room. He has also his friends, and if you want to ask about those games, he will happily answer your queries.

# The Fire Extinguisher Incident

Despite the cheerful early years, the tenth grade proved challenging like everyone else. It was called the Test period, where people's sanity and relationships are tested by Research subjects. It was high time and his research group has not been accepted yet. Dennis, being the jolly and carefree person he is, happily eats lunch. His classmate, who was fuming due to his character, stopped him from eating since he hasn't made the research paper. Little did his classmate know, he got angry and he felt really strong. He lifted a fire extinguisher from the canteen and smacked it to his classmate like a bat. His classmate was sent to the clinic and people helped separate them. He was sent to the Discipline Office, and he got a 1 week suspension.

After the suspension, he started to change. He lost interest to the subjects he engaged with. When he reached Grade 11, he never attended classes anymore. Then by the third quarter, it reached the point where his grades were unable to comply with the policy standards (FYI, 2.50 is the cut-off grade and if one can't reach that, it's goodbye). He tried to accomplish something but eventually the school kicked him out.

Despite him leaving the school, the fire extinguisher he used to smack his classmate remained. You can see it as that fire extinguisher with a sealant and has a dent on it (As of 2020, that fire extinguisher is at the 3rd floor). His actions remained a part of the school's equipment, hence one can say, his legacy lives on.

# Aftermath

Despite the sadness it caused him after leaving school, he went on and made good progress in other schools. They accepted him and he had a fine life. Also, he excelled in the Philippine Chemistry Olympiad, getting 2nd place in the regional circuit. He enrolled in college at a university at the time of this writing, and hopefully getting a degree.
