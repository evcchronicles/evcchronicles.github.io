# The Canal
Back in my second year of highschool, I fell into the school's canal. As far as I know, nobody else fell into it. (Author's note: Sadly. :D)

# The Locked Room
One of the other sections' room was locked. Blocked. They didn't even have a key. They were fucked. (A/N: A more family-friendly replacement: The situation made them feel mocked.)
A stroke of genius came later, however. One of my batchmates thought of something, something involving a few quirks in the building. On top of the door was a boxed hole, supposedly for a few railings. My batchmate then monkied his way up to the door, until he reached the hole... and then he dropped in to visit the other side. Somehow uninjured, he opened the door to make way for the rest of the section.
