Aside from all the supposed conspiracies and *revealed* conspiracies of all of us being surveyed, there was one student from Pisay EVC who was rather adept at snooping. His encyclopedic memory was also quite helpful to him, in fact. With only a few bits of information, he could find the identity of almost anyone, with his memory bank and wide network of informants. In fact, within just the few seconds of meeting him, he would immediately start hounding for your information in hopes of gaining your personal info, scrolling through your Facebook feed, and scrounging up your pictures. Whoever you are, Mr. FBI, you are doing God's work, and He doesn't need a replacement for an Overseer.
