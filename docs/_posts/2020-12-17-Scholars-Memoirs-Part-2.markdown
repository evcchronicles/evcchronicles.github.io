# CR Rescue
"This happened during the Mr. and Mrs. Sportsfest, actually. You should have known that at the last stall of the Boys' CR, the door was broken. I was in the CR, doing CR things, changing clothes, so on. I had to take that last stall. All the other doors were locked, and besides, that last stall had more space.

Once I finished changing, I tried to open the door but it wouldn't even budge. The doorknob was broken and I was basically stuck. The whole thing was happening during the pageant so not a single person could hear my cries for help.

I tried waiting until I thought of texting my friends. Then I remembered a text this morning saying that my load had just expired. So there I was, sitting on the toilet, bored and hungry.

Finally, though, someone had entered the CR and I started asking again for help. He tried pushing the door again, although it still didn't move a bit. Multiple fruitless attempts followed until he just kicked down the door. I was just at the side of the stall, watching the door suddenly swing open, and being very, very in awe.

This guy just kicked a door. And broke some of it.

Turns out he was my senior. I spent a lot of my thanks on him, then made my way back to the bleachers to see my friends again.

Every time I go back to that CR, I can't help but remember that moment"

Lourd: "That's the funny part. I never knew his name."

*Author's Note*: Funnily enough, this reminds me of a similar story of my own. I had just entered the Girls' CR on the first floor and some seniors were inside. Apparently there wasn't a doorknob on the inner side of the door, so when I had just closed it. Bam. Locked. Perhaps I wanted to put on a bit of a show, so I knocked and pleaded in a bit of an exaggerated way, which I suppose might have eased some of the tension. Thankfully, one of the senior girls in that CR called someone, probably her SO and he unlocked the door. Thank God. Who knows? He might be the same as the man in your story, Lourd. The fabled Savior of the CR.
